    <h2>Letra</h2>

    <p>Is this the real life?</p>
    <p>Is this just fantasy?</p>
    <p>Caught in a landslide</p>
    <p>No escape from reality</p>
    <br>
    <p>Open your eyes</p>
    <p>Look up to the skies and see</p>
    <p>I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy</p>
    <p>Because I'm easy come, easy go</p>
    <p>Little high, little low</p>
    <p>Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mama, just killed a man</p>
    <p>Put a gun against his head</p>
    <p>Pulled my trigger, now he's dead</p>
    <p>Mama, life had just begun</p>
    <p>But now I've gone and thrown it all away</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mama, ooh</p>
    <p>Didn't mean to make you cry</p>
    <p>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow</p>
    <p>Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters</p>
    <br>
    <p>Too late, my time has come</p>
    <p>Sends shivers down my spine</p>
    <p>Body's aching all the time</p>
    <p>Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go</p>
    <p>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)</p>
    <p>I don't wanna die</p>
    <p>I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all</p>
    <br>
    <p>I see a little silhouetto of a man</p>
    <p>Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?</p>
    <p>Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me</p>
    <p>(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me</p>
    <p>He's just a poor boy from a poor family</p>
    <p>Spare him his life from this monstrosity</p>
    <br>
    <p>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?</p>
    <p>Bismillah! No, we will not let you go</p>
    <p>(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go</p>
    <p>(Let me go) Bismillah! We will not let you go</p>
    <p>(Let me go) Will not let you go</p>
    <p>(Let me go) Will not let you go</p>
    <p>(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah</p>
    <p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no</p>
    <p>Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go)</p>
    <p>Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me</p>
    <br>
    <p>So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?</p>
    <p>So you think you can love me and leave me to die?</p>
    <p>Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby</p>
    <p>Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah</p>
    <p>Nothing really matters</p>
    <p>Anyone can see</p>
    <p>Nothing really matters</p>
    <p>Nothing really matters to me</p>
    <br>
    <p>Any way the wind blows</p>
